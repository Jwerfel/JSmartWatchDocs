# Status
**NOTE:** This functionality is only available in v1.4 of JSmartWatch (now available!)
<br/>
![JSmartWatch Status](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwerfel/JSmartWatchDocs/DataSource/Images/Status.jpeg)
<br/>
The status page allows you to view the status of groups of devices (locks, windows, doors, garages and presence). This provides a quick view of multiple devices without having to select them one at a time. Also, the same information can be displayed on the watch face in a complication.
<br/>
<br/>
By default, none of your devices will be in groups - you must manually add devices to the correct group. Click on the gear button to setup the status groups
<br/>
<br/>
On the setup page, click on the devices you want to add to a group. Then scroll to the bottom, select the group and press the plus button to add it to a group. Repeat for each group.
<br/>
<br/>
To remove a device from a group, select it and press the minus button.
<br/>
<br/>
When you return to the Status page, the status the devices will be shown. If all devices in a group are locked/closed/present it will show in green. Any devices unlocked/open/not present will make the group appear in red and list the devices.
