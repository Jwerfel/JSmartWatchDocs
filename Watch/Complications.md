<br/>
JSmartWatch can now display the status of your smart home on the watch face. This is supported on the **Infograph Modular** watch face
<br />
<br />
The first step is to configure your status page - see the Status page help for details
<br />
<br />
Once your status page is configured, you can add a complication to your watch face. Edit your Infograph Modular watch face and in the middle (large) area, select the JSmartWatch Status option.

<br />
<br />
Once selected, the status should show on your watch face.  It will update on its own, approximately every 15 minutes.
<br/>**NOTE:** The update interval is controlled by WatchOS and is not precise
<br/>
<br/>
If you do not see the status, tap on the watch face and confirm you see the Status in JSmartWatch. This will also refresh the status on the watch face
